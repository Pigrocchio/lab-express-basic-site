<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>Tardar Sauce (April 4, 2012[1] â€“ May 14, 2019), nicknamed Grumpy Cat, was an American Internet celebrity cat. She was
    known for her permanently "grumpy" facial appearance, which was caused by an underbite and feline dwarfism.[1][2][3] She
    came to prominence when a photograph of her was posted on September 22, 2012, on social news website Reddit by Bryan
    Bundesen, the brother of her owner Tabatha Bundesen.[1][4] Lolcats and parodies created from the photograph by Reddit
    users became viral. She was the subject of a popular Internet meme in which negative, cynical images are made from
    photographs of her.[5]
Tardar Sauce was one of a litter of four kittens born to a calico mother and a blue-and-white tabby putative father at
the home of her owner, Tabatha Bundesen of Morristown, Arizona.[1] The Bundesens said that Tardar Sauce's face appeared
grumpy because the feline had a form of dwarfism.[6] Though the mother and father were described as "normal sized
domestic short hair cats",[6] Tardar Sauce was undersized and had hind legs that are "a bit different".[1] Both she and
her brother, Pokey, were born with "a flat face, bubble eyes, and a short tail".[2] Although she had a "grumpy"
appearance and was called "Grumpy Cat", according to the Bundesens, "Ninety-nine percent of the time she is just a
regular cat."[3]

"Meme manager" Ben Lashes represented Grumpy Cat, in addition to Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat.[7] In 2013, Tabatha Bundesen
took a leave of absence from her job at Red Lobster to manage Grumpy Cat's schedule, while her brother Bryan Bundesen
manages the Grumpy Cat website, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter accounts.[8][9]</p>
